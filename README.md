# Concentration-App

The source code of the **backend** of Concentration, a Chrome extension powered by natural language processing (NLP) and ChatGPT, is stored in this repo.
  - The core algorithms that Concentration uses to block websites can be found in the `app/api` folder.
  - Other code is mainly used for UI purposes (`app/auth` and `app/overview` are for user sign-up/login, `app/error` is for HTTP error handling)
  

The frontend code is stored in a separate Github repo [here](https://github.com/Frank17/Concentration-Frontend).

You may also download Concentration from the Chrome web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/concentration/jkilnegoiabelpjhljiagmmnnppdaajf). Note that this version **may not** be currently up-to-date as it usually takes days for Chrome to publish the most recent changes.
